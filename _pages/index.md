## Biography

I’m an undergraduate student in [**Electrical Engineering**](https://ee.korea.ac.kr/eng) at [**Korea University**](https://korea.edu).

My academic interests include:

- **NLoS (Non-Line-of-Sight) Localization**
- **Message Passing Algorithms (e.g., AMP, Affinity Propagation)**
- **Quantum Algorithms in Signal Processing**

I am currently conducting research on applying the **HHL quantum algorithm** to vehicular localization in NLoS environments, integrating both simulation and real-world deployment using Raspberry Pi.

## Projects

- 📡 **Quantum-enhanced GAMP Solver** for Vehicle NLoS Localization  
  A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm implemented using Qiskit and simulated on QASM, deployed with Raspberry Pi

- 🧠 **Clustering and Message Passing in Visible Light Communication**  
  A novel fusion of GAMP and clustering techniques applied to VLC signal environments (planned)
