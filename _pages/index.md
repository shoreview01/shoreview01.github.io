I’m a graduate student in [LICS (Lab for Informatics, Communications, and Systems)](https://lics.korea.ac.kr) of [**Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering**](https://ee.korea.ac.kr/eng) at [**Korea University**](https://korea.edu), supervised by professor Sang Hyun Lee.

I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in February 2026, with Great Honors.

My academic interests include various optimization methods such as message passing algorithms (e.g., AMP, affinity propagation), machine learning, and quantum computing.
